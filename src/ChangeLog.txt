   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.cxx: Fixed some silly errors; 
   appears to work now.
   
2007-09-25 David Feng <dfeng@cs.unc.edu>
   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.cxx: Basic CPU implementation of
   the maximum likelihood deconvolution filter.
   
2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * JansenVanCitterDeconvolve.cxx: Both CPU and GPU versions of
   this algorithm will rely on the maximum value in the image
   getting computed on the CPU, so we'll start timing after that
   is done. If I get around to an efficient GPU reduction, we can
   find the maximum of the image there and move the timer again.
   
   * WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Put the core of the filter in a
   separate function to ease switching between CPU and GPU. Tried
   a different formulation of the Wiener filter that seems to work
   better than the previous formation, at least in terms of smoothing
   noise during filtering.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * JansenVanCitterDeconvolve.cxx, WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Added
   timings for execution of the entire algorithm.
   
   * Stopwatch.cxx: New timer class from GLVU.
   
2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.cxx: Removed fftwf_cleanup_threads from the UnRegister
   function because it destroys accumulated FFTW wisdom, which we don't
   really want to happen. Also, SetNumberOfThreads now tells FFTW to
   plan FFTs with the specified number of threads.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.cxx: Changed Init and Destroy functions to Register
   and UnRegister, which more accurately reflects how the library
   should be initialized and released by callers.
   
   * FFT.cxx: OpenMP fixups.
   
   * JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx: Changed how omp.h is included.
   Removed iostream include.
   
   * WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Cleaned up include statements, parallelized
   a loop I had missed before.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FFT.cxx: Added memory allocation functions and a convolution
   function.
   
   * JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx: Cleaned up and refactored into
   more manageable pieces.
   
   * WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Cleaned up and changed to use new memory
   allocation functions.

2007-09-22 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx: Added CPU implementation.
   
   * WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Finished CPU implementation.

2007-09-21 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FFT.cxx: My understanding of row-major order is not the same as that
   of FFTW, causing me much consternation. The fix was simple: reverse the
   order of the image dimensions.
   
   * IDivergenceDeconvolve.cxx, JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx,
   SmoothedJansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx, WienerDeconvolve.cxx:
   Function signature changes.

2007-09-19 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FFT.cxx: Initial check-in of functions for taking the FFT of
   real-valued images. Simpler than FFTW's interface. Also, this will
   let us swap out the underlying FFT library in the future more easily
   (FFTW is under GPL).
   
   * IDivergenceDeconvolve.cxx, JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx,
   SmoothedJansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx: Changed to reflect changes in 
   signature of functions.
   
   * WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Changed to reflect changes in signature of
   function. Inserted a forward and inverse Fourier transform to test out
   FFT functions.

2007-09-18 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * IDivergenceDeconvolve.cxx, JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx,
   SmoothedJansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx: Set algorithm outputs to
   all zeros for now.

2007-09-18 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Fixed loop index error.

2007-09-17 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.cxx, IDivergenceDeconvolve.cxx,
   JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx, SmoothJansenVanCittertDeconvolve.cxx,
   WienerDeconvolve.cxx: Initial check-in.
