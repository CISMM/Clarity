2008-12-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt: Updated build instructions.

2008-12-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added inclusion of the gomp (GNU OpenMP) library
   if the compiler is GNU. Fixed inclusion of FFTW library for CUDA
   and non-CUDA builds.

2008-12-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Removed commands for finding FFTW and placed them
   in a separate module.

2008-12-12  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added tests subdirectory.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt: Updated with instructions for linux.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added FOUND_CUFFT to link libraries when compiling
     with CUDA support. This basically points it to the cufft.lib file
     in the CUDA installation.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Removed linked library cufft.lib. New version
   of FindCUDA.cmake takes care of this.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source files ComputePrimitives.cxx and
   ComputePrimitivesGPU.cu, removed MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolveGPU.cu.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added include/internal directory to set of
   include directories.
   
   * HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt: Bumped up recommended CUDA runtime version
   from 1.0 to 1.1.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Added source file BlindMaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.cxx.

2008-09-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

	* CMakeLists.txt: Added source files ImageClip.cxx and
	ImagePadSpatialShift.cxx.

2007-10-23  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

	* Clarity.h.in: Fixed Clarity version number derived from
	CMakeLists.txt. Added BUILD_WITH_CUDA macro derived from
	CMake configuration.
	
	* CMakeLists.txt: Added option to build with CUDA or not.
	
	* HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt: Updated build instructions.

2007-09-30  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added source files and now links to cufft.lib
   (CUDA FFT library).

2007-09-28  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added CUDA source files and inclusion of
   FindCUDA.cmake. CUDA is mandatory at the moment, but really
   should be optional in the future.
   
   * HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt: Added instructions for telling CMake
   to find CUDA dependencies.

2007-09-27  David Marshburn  <marshbur@cs.unc.edu>

	* HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt:  added notes related to FFTW3.

2007-09-26 David Feng <dfeng@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added Stopwatch.cxx to list of source files.
   
2007-09-26 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMake/*: CMake scripts from Abe Stephens at Utah for including
   CUDA files (relatively) painlessly in a CMake project. Note:
   it doesn't seem to generate libraries correctly in Visual Studio 2005
   when generating project files. NMake files, however, work just fine.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added Stopwatch.cxx to list of source files.

2007-09-19 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h.in: Fixed include file name (case was wrong).
   
   * CMakeLists.txt: Added CMake directives that cause CMake to ask for
   FFTW libraries. Added FFT.cxx source file.

2007-09-18 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * HOWTO-Build-Clarity.txt: Initial check-in of instructions on how
   to build the Clarity library.

2007-09-18 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Added Clarity.cxx source file to project.

2007-09-17 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h.in, CMakeLists.txt: Initial check-in.
