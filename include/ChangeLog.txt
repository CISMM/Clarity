2008-12-14  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Added licensing to top of the file.

2008-12-12  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Major changes and cleanup of nearly all function prototypes.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Created Dim3 type for specifying image dimensions. Chagned
   function prototypes to use this type for image dimension specifications.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Moved all "private" library headers from this level down to new
   internal directory. Clarity.h, which contains functions the library
   exposes to clients, remains here.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

	* Clarity.h: Added function Clarity_BlindMaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.
	
	* MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h: Added function prototypes for
	the update step in max likelihood deconvolution. Two prototypes here,
	one for CPU and one for GPU.

2008-09-08  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

	* Clarity.h: Added documentation for each publicly-accessible function
	in the library. Also, added a new error enum, CLARITY_INVALID_ARGUMENT.

2007-09-30 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Added some error enumerants, added an externally-accessible
   convolution function which is generally useful.
   
   * Complex.h: Added ComplexMultiplyAndScale function for multiplying the
   result of a complex multiplication by a real value.
   
   * ComplexCUDA.h: CUDA versions of complex math functions. Maybe want to combine
   with the above file to eliminate redundancy.
   
   * FFT.h: Added functions for copying data to and from a "device" (e.g. 
   NVIDIA 8800 GTX card). Added convenience function that allocates memory on the 
   device and copies data from a buffer on the host. Added a function for
   performing pixel-wise multiplication. Added an internal convolution
   function.

2007-09-29 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FFT.h: Changed some function names to be clearer in meaning.

2007-09-26 David Feng <dfeng@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Fixed an argument type defintion (unsigned instead of int).
   
2007-09-25 David Feng <dfeng@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Added maximum likelihood filter function.
   
2007-09-25 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Complex.h: Added ComplexConjugate function.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Stopwatch.h: Added this class for taking timings.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Changed functions Init and Destroy to Register and UnRegister.

2007-09-24 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FFT.h: Added some memory allocation functions specifically for holding
   the results of Fourier transforms (real-to-complex and complex-to-real).

2007-09-22 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Added a noise standard deviation and epsilon parameters to
   Clarity_WienerDeconvolve.
   
   * Complex.h: Added a couple more useful complex operations.

2007-09-21 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Somewhat inconsequential rearrangement of function parameters.
   
   * Complex.h: New complex math inline functions.

2007-09-17 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Added some enumerants to ClarityResult_t enum.
   Changed most of the function signatures.

   * FFT.h: Header for abstracting away the underlying FFT library.

2007-09-17 Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Clarity.h: Initial check-in.
