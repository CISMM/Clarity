   * CMakeLists.txt: Removed this file; should have been named
   ChangeLog.txt (this file replaces it).
   
   * Complex.h, ComplexCUDA.h: Added comments for functions.

   * Convolve.h: New file for convolution-related routines.
   
   * FFT.h: Removed a lot of non-FFT related function prototypes and put them
   in more appropriate files (e.g. Convolve.h).
   
   * JansenVanCittertDeconvolveGPU.h: New file containing GPU device 
   function prototype for this deconvolution method.
   
   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h: Added comments to the prototype 
   in this file.
   
   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolveGPU.h: Moved GPU-related function
   prototypes here.
   
   * Memory.h: New file with memory allocation and data transfer-related
   function prototypes.
   
   * WienerDeconvolveGPU.h: New file containing GPU device function
   prototype for this deconvolution method.

   * All files: Moved from one directory level up. These header files
   are internal to the library and really shouldn't be exposed to
   client applications or libraries.
