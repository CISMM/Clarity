   * Complex.h, ComplexCUDA.h, ComputePrimitives.h, ComputePrimitivesGPU.h,
   Convolve.h, FFT.h, JansenVanCittertDeconvolveGPU.h,
   MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h, MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolveGPU.h,
   Memory.h, WienerDeconvolveGPU.h: Added licensing to top of files.

2008-12-12  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * ComputePrimitivesGPU.h: Added documentation for a parameter in function
   Clarity_DivideArraysComponentWiseGPU.

   * Convolve.h: Removed Clarity_Convolve function prototype because it is
   in Clarity.h.

   * JansenVanCittertDeconvolveGPU.h: Fixed documentation of function.

   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h: Added parameter documentation for a
   function.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * FFT.h: Added C linkage declaration in front of functions in this file.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Memory.h: Added include for cstring so that size_t is defined.

2008-12-10  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * Complex.h, ComputePrimitives.h, Convolve.h, 
   JansenVanCittertDeconvolve.h, MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h,
   MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolveGPU.h, WienerDeconvolveGPU.h:
   Added newlines at the end of these files to keep gcc from complaining.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * ComputePrimitives.h: New file with prototypes for a variety of
   parallel computing primitives.
   
   * ComputePrimitivesGPU.h: CUDA versions of prototypes in
   ComputePrimitives.h.
   
   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h: Formatting changes.

2008-09-11  Cory Quammen <cquammen@cs.unc.edu>

   * CMakeLists.txt: Removed this file; should have been named
   ChangeLog.txt (this file replaces it).
   
   * Complex.h, ComplexCUDA.h: Added comments for functions.

   * Convolve.h: New file for convolution-related routines.
   
   * FFT.h: Removed a lot of non-FFT related function prototypes and put them
   in more appropriate files (e.g. Convolve.h).
   
   * JansenVanCittertDeconvolveGPU.h: New file containing GPU device 
   function prototype for this deconvolution method.
   
   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolve.h: Added comments to the prototype 
   in this file.
   
   * MaximumLikelihoodDeconvolveGPU.h: Moved GPU-related function
   prototypes here.
   
   * Memory.h: New file with memory allocation and data transfer-related
   function prototypes.
   
   * WienerDeconvolveGPU.h: New file containing GPU device function
   prototype for this deconvolution method.

   * All files: Moved from one directory level up. These header files
   are internal to the library and really shouldn't be exposed to
   client applications or libraries.
