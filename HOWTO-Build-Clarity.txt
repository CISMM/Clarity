HOWTO for building Clarity library.

1). If building on Windows, download and install/unzip FFTW3 from http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html. Follow the instructions on that page to create the .lib files.

2). If building on linux, download the source from http://www.fftw.org/download.html. Untar the file and go to the fftw source library. Run the 'configure' script with the options '--enable-single' and '--enable-threads'.

3). Fire up CMake. Set the Clarity root directory as the source code directory, and pick a build directory.

4). Set BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to "ON" if you so choose.

5). If you want to build with CUDA-acceleration, set BUILD_WITH_CUDA to "ON", and continue with these directions. Otherwise, skip to Step 8.

6). Download and install CUDA Toolkit, Version 2.0 or later from http://developer.nvidia.com/object/cuda.html. Pick the default install directory if you can, otherwise remember where you installed CUDA. If you are on a system with a CUDA-enabled graphics card, you should probably also install the latest NVIDIA display drivers.

7). Configure the CUDA settings, set CUDA_BUILD_TYPE to "Device". If CUDA_INSTALL_PREFIX does not give a valid path name, set the path to your CUDA Toolkit installation directory.

8). In CMake, set FFTW_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory where you installed FFTW3, and set FFTW_LIBRARY to that same directory but with libfftw3f-3.lib appended to the end (libfftw3.a in linux).

9). Click "Configure" (type "c" in linux) and click "OK" (type "g" in linux). CMake will build the project files (makefiles) and exit.

10). Navigate to the Clarity build directory you created in Step 2. Under Windows, open Clarity.sln. Under linux, type "make".

11). Select a build configuration and build the solution.
