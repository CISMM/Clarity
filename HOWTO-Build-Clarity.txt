1). Check out Clarity from the Nano repository (:extssh:<username>@cvs.cs.unc.edu:/afs/cs.unc.edu/project/stm/src/CVS_repository)

2). Fire up CMake and set Clarity root directory as the source code directory, and pick a build directory.

2.1). Download and install/unzip FFTW3 from http://www.fftw.org/install/windows.html.
	Follow the instructions on that page to create the .lib files.
2.2). In CMake, set FFT3_INCLUDE_DIR to the directory where you unzipped FFTW3
	and FFTW3_LIBRARY to libfftw3-3.lib (the double-precision library)

3). Click "Configure" and click "OK". CMake will exit.

4). Navigate to the Clarity build directory set in step 2 and open Clarity.sln.

5). Select a build configuration and build the solution.
