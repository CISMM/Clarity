   * DeconvolveRawImages: New example application that shows how to use
    Clarity. It reads RAW files consisting of unsigned shorts in 
    little-endian byte orientation. You have to tell it the size of the
    image and the PSF through the command line. Not ideal, but if you want
    something fancier, you almost have to use a library that can read
    various image formats.

   * CMakeLists.txt: Initial check-in.
